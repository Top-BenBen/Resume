#ABOUT

I’m a Data Analytics professional with a strong background in turning raw data into actionable insights that drive business growth. With over three years of experience across sectors like education, marketing, e-commerce, and operations, I specialize in data storytelling, dashboard development, statistical analysis, and business reporting.

My technical toolkit includes SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python, and MySQL, which I use to uncover trends, measure performance, and support strategic decisions. I’m especially passionate about helping organizations bridge the gap between data complexity and business clarity.

In addition to my analytical work, I serve as a career coach and mentor, guiding aspiring analysts on their journey to break into tech. I also actively share educational content through writing, visuals, and video to democratize data literacy.

Whether it’s optimizing processes, tracking KPIs, or building scalable reporting systems, I bring a collaborative and insight-driven approach to every project.

I’m always open to connecting with professionals, organizations, and data-driven teams who believe in the power of analytics to transform outcomes.
