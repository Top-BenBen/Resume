# PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Data Analyst with hands-on experience across various sectors, now focused on using data to drive strategic decision-making in the food manufacturing space. Passionate about analysing trends in product performance, market demand, and consumer behaviour to support sales growth, marketing optimisation, and operational efficiency. Skilled in SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, with a strong foundation in statistical analysis, reporting, and data storytelling. I’ve applied these tools to real-world projects involving client retention, academic performance, and marketing performance experiences that sharpened my ability to translate raw data into clear, actionable insights. Through training programs, fieldwork, and analytics boot camps, I’ve developed a strong grasp of how to build dashboards, perform deep-dive analyses, and support cross-functional teams with data that fuels smart decisions. I am particularly excited about contributing to a food production environment where data can uncover customer trends, optimize supply chains, and enhance product positioning. I am fully prepared for both remote and on-site collaboration, with practical experience working across distributed teams using tools like GitHub, Trello, SharePoint, and Google Workspace. I bring curiosity, a commercial mindset, and a drive for measurable outcomes.
